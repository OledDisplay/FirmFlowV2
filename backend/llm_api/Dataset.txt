Understood! I will conduct deep research on Bulgarian laws and processes related to starting a business. This will include all business models, legal requirements, necessary registrations, taxation, funding options (including business angels and venture capital), location-based regulations, and any other essential aspects. The report will be in English with a focus on proper translation, and I will provide legal references where needed. If any detailed documents cannot be fully included, I will provide links to them.
I will notify you once the comprehensive dataset is ready.
Setting Up and Running a Business in Bulgaria: Legal Framework
Legal Forms of Business in Bulgaria
Bulgaria offers a range of business entity types to suit different needs. The primary forms under the Commerce Act include: Sole Proprietor (ET), Limited Liability Company (LLC) – in Bulgarian druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost (abbreviated OOD for multi-member or EOOD for single-member), Joint-Stock Company (JSC) – aktsionerno druzhestvo (AD or single-owner EAD), as well as General Partnership (SD) and Limited Partnership (KD) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). There is also a less common form called Partnership Limited by Shares (KDA) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). In addition, business may be conducted via a Branch of a foreign company or a Trade Representative Office (TRO), and cooperatives exist under a separate law (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). Each type has specific legal characteristics in terms of liability, capital, and governance:
•	Sole Proprietor (ET) – a business owned by one individual, with no separate legal personality. The owner has unlimited personal liability for business debts (all personal assets can be used to settle obligations) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). No minimum capital is required, making it easy to start. However, because liability is unlimited, this form suits very small ventures. The owner is considered self-employed and must pay income tax and social insurance on the business profits (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
•	Limited Liability Company (OOD/EOOD) – a company with its own legal identity separate from the owners. Owners (called partners or shareholders) have limited liability up to the amount of their capital contribution (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). The minimum capital is only BGN 2 (approx €1) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). An OOD can have multiple owners, while an EOOD has a single owner (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). This is the most common form for small and medium businesses due to the liability protection and low capital requirement. Profits are subject to corporate tax.
•	Joint-Stock Company (AD/EAD) – a company whose capital is divided into shares. It requires a higher minimum capital of BGN 50,000 (approx €25,000) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Shareholders’ liability is limited to their share contribution (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). An AD can raise capital by issuing shares and is suited for larger enterprises or those considering many investors. It has more complex governance (a Board of Directors or Supervisory/Management Boards) and stricter rules. A single-shareholder joint-stock company is EAD (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
•	General Partnership (SD) – a partnership of two or more persons who jointly operate a business under a common name. All partners have unlimited liability for the partnership’s debts (partners are personally liable jointly and severally) (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). There is no capital requirement. This form is rarely used due to the risk of personal liability.
•	Limited Partnership (KD) – consists of at least one general partner with unlimited liability and one or more limited partners whose liability is capped at their contribution. The general partner manages the business, while limited partners are mostly investors (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). No minimum capital is mandated by law, but the partnership agreement will set contributions. A variation is the Partnership Limited by Shares (KDA) where limited partners’ interests are represented by shares (mixing features of a JSC and partnership) (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy).
•	Branch of a Foreign Company – a foreign company can register a branch in Bulgaria to do business (Doing business in Bulgaria ). A branch is not a separate legal entity (liabilities accrue to the parent company) but must be entered in the Bulgarian Commercial Register and comply with local laws (Doing business in Bulgaria ). It must have a local address and an appointed representative. No capital requirement exists for a branch, but it needs its parent’s funds to operate.
•	Trade Representative Office (TRO) – a non-commercial presence for foreign companies. It is not allowed to conduct business or earn revenue in Bulgaria (used mainly for marketing, liaison, or research) (Doing business in Bulgaria ). TROs register with the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, not the Commercial Register.
•	Cooperative – a form of collective owned by members, typically regulated by the Cooperatives Act. Cooperatives have legal personality and are meant for mutual economic benefit of members (common in agriculture and credit). They are not “commercial companies” under the Commerce Act, but they are another vehicle to conduct business jointly.
Choosing the legal form is an important first step and depends on factors like the number of founders, desired liability protection, capital availability, and future plans (e.g. attracting investors) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). Foreign investors are treated equally to local ones – 100% foreign ownership is allowed in Bulgarian companies (even in an LLC or JSC) with no restriction on capital repatriation (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). Note that founders who have been bankrupt or convicted of certain commercial offenses may be disqualified from registering businesses in their own name (e.g. an individual cannot register as a sole proprietor if they have unresolved bankruptcies) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
Company Registration Process in Bulgaria
(How To Register A Company In Bulgaria In 5 Easy Steps!) Registering a business in Bulgaria involves a clear step-by-step procedure, mostly handled by the Commercial Register at the Registry Agency. The process is relatively fast and can often be completed within a few days if documentation is in order. Below is an overview of the registration steps for the most common business models:
Registering a Sole Proprietorship (ET)
A sole proprietor is essentially an individual trading under a business name. Any adult resident of Bulgaria can register as a sole trader, provided they are not barred by law (e.g. not an undischarged bankrupt or convicted for certain economic crimes) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The registration steps are:
1.	Choose a Business Name – The name of a sole proprietor must include the individual’s own first and last name (no abbreviations) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). For example, “ET Ivan Petrov” (ET stands for Ednolichen Targovets). A name reservation is not mandatory but can be done to secure the name prior to application (optional step) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
2.	Prepare Documents – There is no requirement for founding capital or partners. The individual must prepare a registration application (Form A1) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry), a specimen signature notarized (the trader’s sample signature) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry), and a declaration that none of the legal disqualifications apply (that they are not under bankruptcy, etc.) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). These forms are available on the Registry Agency’s website.
3.	Submit Application to Commercial Register – File the application in person at the Registry Agency office or online via the registry portal (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Filing electronically requires a qualified electronic signature (digital certificate) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The state fee is BGN 30 for paper filing or BGN 15 for electronic filing (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The application will be reviewed and, if in order, the sole proprietor is entered into the Commercial Register and assigned a Unique Identification Code (UIC/BULSTAT number).
4.	Post-registration Tax Steps – Upon registration, the sole proprietor should register with the tax authorities (NRA) to obtain VAT registration if needed (see taxation section) and register for social security as self-insured. If the business engages in certain small-scale activities (like crafts or local services), the owner may fall under the “patent tax” regime instead of standard income tax (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Patent tax applies if annual turnover was below BGN 50,000 in the previous year and the person is not VAT-registered (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). In such cases, the owner pays a fixed municipal tax for the activity (in lieu of income tax).
Sole proprietors enjoy simplicity (no need for company governance or capital) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry), but they carry personal liability for debts (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Terminating a sole proprietorship is also relatively easy – one can deregister from the Commercial Register with a simple application, without the formal liquidation required for companies (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
Registering a Limited Liability Company (OOD/EOOD)
Most entrepreneurs opt for an LLC due to limited liability and flexibility. The incorporation of an OOD/EOOD involves these key steps (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry):
1.	Reserve a Company Name (Optional) – You may reserve the desired company name in advance with the Commercial Register (to prevent others from taking it) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Reservation costs BGN 40 (or BGN 20 if done online) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) and holds the name for a set period. This step is optional because you can also directly submit the name with the incorporation documents (the registry will register it if available).
2.	Hold a Constitutive Meeting & Sign Documents – If there are multiple founders, they must hold a Constituent Assembly (founders’ meeting) to adopt the decision to form the company (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). They approve the Articles of Association (for multi-member OOD) or a Founder’s Act (for single-member EOOD) outlining the company’s name, purpose, registered address, capital, ownership shares, management structure, etc. (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The Articles must at minimum state the company name, seat and address, business activity, amount of capital and each owner’s share, management bodies, and any special conditions or rights (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Minutes of the meeting are drafted and signed (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). In an EOOD (one owner), a sole founder’s written decision and incorporation act suffice. At this stage, the founders also appoint the Managing Director(s) of the company.
3.	Deposit the Capital in a Bank – Before registration, the founders must open a special escrow bank account in the company’s name (in organization) and deposit at least the minimum capital (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). For an OOD/EOOD, the minimum capital is BGN 2 by law (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry), however if a higher capital is declared, at least 70% of it must be paid in before registration (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The bank issues a certificate of capital deposit, which will be needed for the registration application (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). (Note: funds remain frozen until the company is officially registered).
4.	Obtain Licenses/Permits (if applicable) – If the new company’s business activity is in a regulated sector (e.g. financial services, insurance, sale of alcohol, etc.), you may need to secure a preliminary license or permission from the competent authority before registration (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). For example, a company planning to trade in tobacco or operate as a tour operator must have a permit from the relevant agency. This license (or proof of application) would accompany the registration documents (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
5.	Submit Incorporation Application – File the registration application (Form A4) with the Commercial Register, attaching all required documents (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The typical document set for an OOD includes: the Articles of Association (or incorporation act), minutes of the founders’ meeting (if multi-member), the notarized specimen signature of the managing director(s) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry), a consent & declaration by the director under Article 141 of the Commerce Act that they are eligible (not banned from management) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry), the bank certificate for capital deposited (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry), a declaration of truth of documents (per Commercial Register Act art.13(4)) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry), and a document for the state fee paid. If any founder is a legal entity, you also attach a copy of its registration and a resolution of that entity to participate in the new company (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Any required license (from step 4) is attached as well (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
6.	Pay State Fees – The state registration fee for an LLC is BGN 110 for paper filing or BGN 55 if filed electronically with e-signature (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Notary fees (~BGN 6 per signature) apply for certifying the manager’s specimen signature (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). (Other minor costs: bank fee for opening the escrow account, typically around BGN 10-20).
7.	Registration Confirmation – The Registry Agency usually processes the application within a few days. Once approved, the company is officially entered into the Commercial Register and exists as a legal entity. The company then receives a 9-digit UIC (Unique Identification Code) which is used as its identification for all purposes (also serving as its tax number).
8.	Post-incorporation Actions – After registration, the LLC should register with the tax authorities. In Bulgaria, corporate entities are automatically obliged to file tax returns, but if the company will be active, it may need to register for VAT if it expects to cross the turnover threshold (see Taxation section). The company must also register any employees with the National Revenue Agency (for social security) when it hires staff.
Setting up an OOD/EOOD in Bulgaria is notably straightforward. The entire incorporation can be done remotely via power of attorney and electronic filing, which is useful for foreign investors (How To Register A Company In Bulgaria In 5 Easy Steps!) (How To Register A Company In Bulgaria In 5 Easy Steps!). The low capital requirement (BGN 2) is attractive, though in practice many entrepreneurs deposit a slightly higher capital for credibility. One should keep in mind that closing an LLC, if needed, requires a formal liquidation process (appointing a liquidator, publishing invitations to creditors, etc.), which can take several months (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Thus, choosing the right entity type at the start is important.
Registering a Joint-Stock Company (AD/EAD)
The process for a Joint-Stock Company is more complex, given the larger scale and capital:
1.	Name Reservation (Optional) – Similar to LLCs, you may reserve the company name in advance (BGN 40 fee, optional) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
2.	Founding General Meeting – An AD is founded by a Constituent Assembly of incorporators (at least 2 for AD; an EAD can have 1 shareholder) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). All founding shareholders (or their notarized proxies) meet and take unanimous decisions to: establish the company, approve the company Statutes (the equivalent of articles/bylaws for a JSC), and appoint the initial boards (either a Board of Directors in a one-tier system or a Supervisory Board and Management Board in a two-tier system) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The statutes of an AD are detailed, containing information required by Art.165 of the Commerce Act, such as company name, purpose, term, capital amount and types of shares, rights of each class of shares, governance structure and term of directors, how profits will be distributed, how general meetings are convened, etc. (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Minutes of this founding meeting are drafted and signed (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). In an EAD (single shareholder company), a Founder’s Act and Statutes are executed by the sole owner instead of a meeting (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
3.	Capital Subscription & Deposit – The minimum share capital is BGN 50,000 (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). At least 25% of the value of each share must be paid in prior to registration (the rest can be paid within 2 years if the statutes allow) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The founders open a bank escrow account in the company’s (in-formation) name and deposit the paid-in capital – at least BGN 12,500 if minimum capital, or 25% of each share’s issue price if higher capital (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The bank provides a capital certificate. In return for deposits, founders receive interim share certificates; formal share certificates can be issued only after registration (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
4.	Appoint Directors and Auditors – The founders appoint the Board of Directors (for one-tier) or Supervisory Board (which then appoints a Management Board) for two-tier governance (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). They also typically appoint an independent auditor to verify the financial statements (annual audit is mandatory for ADs). A joint-stock company may have a one-tier board (Board of Directors of 3 to 9 members managing the company) or a two-tier system (a Supervisory Board overseeing, and a Management Board running daily affairs) – both systems are allowed under Bulgarian law, and the choice is made in the Statutes. (Important note: ADs in banking or insurance sector require more capital and possibly two-tier boards by special laws).
5.	Licenses for Regulated Activities – If the AD will engage in a licensed activity (banking, insurance, investment services, etc.), it must obtain the respective license from authorities (e.g. Bulgarian National Bank or Financial Supervision Commission) before registering the company. Proof of license or pending application is needed for registration.
6.	Register the AD with Commercial Register – Submit the registration application (Form A5) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) with required documents: the Statutes, the minutes of the constituent meeting (or founder’s act for EAD), the bank certificate for deposited capital, notarized specimen signatures of the board members or managing directors, declarations by them (similar to LLC) that they meet legal requirements, any license obtained, and proof of paid state fee (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The Registry will check that all pre-conditions are met: capital is fully subscribed, at least 25% paid in, Statutes adopted, and boards appointed (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
7.	Pay State Fees – The state fee for JSC registration is higher: BGN 360 for standard AD/EAD, or BGN 180 if filing electronically (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). (For companies in banking or insurance, the fee is much higher, e.g. BGN 1,300 on paper (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry)). Notary and bank fees also apply as in LLC.
8.	Obtain Registration – Once the Commercial Register processes and approves the application, the AD/EAD is entered as a joint-stock company. The company can then replace interim certificates with formal share certificates and commence operations. The JSC must also register for taxes and social security as needed.
A joint-stock company offers easier transferability of ownership (shares can be sold without affecting the company’s existence) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) and can access equity financing, but it has more onerous ongoing obligations. For instance, ADs must hold annual general meetings of shareholders to approve financial statements and other key decisions, and large ADs may be subject to independent financial audit each year (Doing business in Bulgaria ) (Doing business in Bulgaria ). ADs are also subject to more stringent accounting and disclosure rules – for example, they are required to publish annual financial statements and may need to have a registered auditor (Doing business in Bulgaria ) (Doing business in Bulgaria ). Given the complexity, ADs are usually used by larger businesses or those aiming to eventually go public.
Other Forms – Partnerships, Branches, and Non-profits
•	General and Limited Partnerships: To register an SD (general partnership) or KD (limited partnership), the partners must execute a Partnership Agreement and file an application with the Commercial Register, similar to companies. The agreement sets the terms between partners (capital contributions, profit sharing, management). All partners sign the application (ESTABLISH A COMPANY IN BULGARIA - Excellence BC). There is no minimum capital, but each partner’s contribution (money, property, or labor) is listed. A KD must designate which partners are general (unlimited liability) and which are limited. If a limited partner’s name is included in the firm name, by law they become liable as a general partner ([PDF] COMMERCIAL LAW). Partnerships are relatively rare; however, registration is simpler than for companies (fewer documents since no complex corporate structure). They still obtain a UIC and are taxable entities.
•	Branch of a Foreign Company: A foreign company registers a branch by filing a set of documents including a resolution of the parent company’s management to open the branch, the parent’s incorporation certificate, and specifying the local branch manager and address (Doing business in Bulgaria ) (Doing business in Bulgaria ). The branch does not have separate capital. It must carry the same name as the parent with “Branch – Bulgaria” added (Doing business in Bulgaria ). Once registered, the branch can conduct activities in Bulgaria on behalf of the parent. The branch must maintain accounts for its operations and the parent must report the branch’s results in Bulgaria (for taxation on Bulgarian-source income) – effectively it’s a “permanent establishment” of the foreign firm (Doing business in Bulgaria ).
•	Non-Profit and Others: If one wants to set up a Non-profit association or foundation, those are registered in a separate Register of Non-Profit Legal Entities (also managed by the Registry Agency). Though not “commercial”, they might be relevant for social enterprises or NGOs. They have their own legal requirements (governed by the Non-Profit Legal Entities Act).
After registration of any business entity, it is important to comply with a few immediate requirements: making a company seal (optional – since 2016, company seals are no longer mandatory in Bulgaria), printing invoices with the company details for use, and registering labor contracts if hiring employees (every employment contract must be registered with the National Revenue Agency within 3 days of signing). The company’s UIC serves as the tax ID; however, if the company will perform VAT-taxable activities, separate VAT registration is required (covered below).
Business Taxation and Financial Reporting
Taxation in Bulgaria is relatively business-friendly, with low flat tax rates. Key taxes affecting businesses include corporate income tax, value-added tax (VAT), personal income tax for individuals (including sole traders), and social insurance contributions. Below is an overview:
•	Corporate Income Tax (CIT): Bulgaria imposes a flat 10% corporate tax on profits (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy) – one of the lowest rates in the EU. This tax applies to profits of local companies worldwide and to Bulgarian-source profits of foreign entities (including branches) (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy). Taxable profit is based on accounting profit adjusted for tax rules. Certain expenses (e.g. representation costs, fringe benefits) incur a final tax of 10% on the expense (instead of being fully deductible) (Doing business in Bulgaria ) (Doing business in Bulgaria ). Tax returns are filed annually – typically by 31 March of the following year in the past, though recent changes moved the deadline to 30 June to coincide with financial statement filing. Tax losses can be carried forward for up to 5 years to offset future profits (Doing business in Bulgaria ) (Doing business in Bulgaria ). There is no alternative minimum tax or local profit taxes (Doing business in Bulgaria ) (Doing business in Bulgaria ). Bulgaria has an extensive network of double taxation treaties to avoid international double tax, and foreign tax credits can apply under those treaties (Legal, Tax and other Business Information – BG Embassy).
•	Withholding Taxes: Certain payments abroad by Bulgarian companies face withholding tax (unless reduced by a treaty or EU directive) – e.g. dividends to foreign individuals or non-EU companies are taxed at 5%, interest and royalties to non-residents at 5% or 10%, and certain service fees at 10%. EU parent companies can often receive dividends free of withholding under the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive (if conditions met).
•	Personal Income Tax & Sole Trader Taxation: Bulgaria also has a flat 10% personal income tax on individuals. A sole proprietor (ET) generally pays personal income tax on their business profits (after deducting allowable expenses) at 15% (a slightly higher rate applies to income from business as sole trader) or at 10% if under the general regime – this depends on tax category, but many ET incomes are treated as business income at 15%. However, small sole traders under the patent tax regime pay a fixed annual tax to the municipality instead of income tax (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). The patent tax amount varies by type of activity (set by each municipality’s schedule) – it covers trades like barbers, crafts, small retail, etc., and is applicable only if turnover was under BGN 50,000 and not VAT-registered (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). For other freelancers or civil contractors, the 10% flat tax applies on net income.
•	Social Security Contributions: Employers and employees must pay social security on salaries. The system covers pensions, health insurance, unemployment, and other funds. The total contribution rate is roughly 32-33% of gross wage for most activities, of which about 60% is paid by the employer and 40% by the employee (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). For example, an employer may pay ~18-19% and the employee ~13-14% (the exact split can vary by labor category). These contributions are capped at a maximum monthly income (BGN 3,400 for 2023, subject to change). A sole proprietor or freelancer must pay contributions as a self-insured person on a minimum self-employed income (often around BGN 710 minimum base) – covering pension and health. Social contributions are important to comply with, as non-payment can lead to penalties and loss of benefits for employees.
•	Value Added Tax (VAT): Bulgaria, as an EU member, applies VAT on the supply of goods and services. The standard VAT rate is 20% on most goods/services (Bulgaria - Corporate - Other taxes). A reduced rate of 9% applies to certain categories like hotel accommodations, books and some baby goods, and temporarily (until end of 2024) on restaurant catering services (Bulgaria - Corporate - Other taxes) (Bulgaria - Corporate - Other taxes). Exports, intra-EU sales, and international transport are zero-rated (0% VAT) (Bulgaria - Corporate - Other taxes), and some activities (financial services, health, education, etc.) are exempt from VAT (Bulgaria - Corporate - Other taxes). VAT registration becomes mandatory once a business’s taxable turnover in Bulgaria exceeds a threshold – currently BGN 100,000 in any 12-month period (≈ €51,000), with this threshold set to rise to BGN 166,000 from 1 Jan 2025 (Bulgaria - Corporate - Other taxes). There are also specific cases requiring earlier registration (e.g. if you provide services to EU businesses or import goods, there are lower thresholds or immediate registration requirements). A business may also register voluntarily for VAT even before reaching the threshold (Bulgaria - Corporate - Other taxes) – sometimes done to reclaim input VAT on purchases or to appear more credible to partners. Once registered, the company must charge 20% VAT on its sales (for domestic customers) and file monthly VAT returns. VAT returns and payments are due by the 14th of the following month (Bulgaria - Corporate - Other taxes). VAT-registered businesses can generally credit or refund the VAT on their purchases against the VAT on sales. Bulgaria follows the EU VAT Directive, so intra-EU transactions are subject to the reverse charge mechanism or intra-community supply rules as appropriate.
•	Local Taxes and Fees: Municipalities impose some taxes such as annual property tax on real estate, vehicle tax for owned vehicles, and garbage collection fees. These are usually modest but vary by locality. If a company owns real property, it must pay property tax (around 0.1-0.3% of the property value per year, rate set by municipality). These are declared to the local tax office. There is no local business profits tax, only these property-related taxes.
•	Accounting and Financial Reporting: All companies must keep accounting records in accordance with the Bulgarian Accountancy Act, which is harmonized with IFRS for certain entities. Small and medium enterprises may use national accounting standards which align with EU directives. Annual financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, equity statement and notes) are required for all companies for each calendar year (Doing business in Bulgaria ). The financial statements must be approved by the owners (General Meeting) and then submitted for publication in the Commercial Register by 30 June of the following year (for most companies) to ensure transparency (Doing business in Bulgaria ). Additionally, an annual corporate tax return is filed with the NRA, usually by 30 June, accompanied by the financial statements. Certain companies are required to have an independent financial audit by licensed auditors – for example, medium and large enterprises, public-interest entities, and JSCs above certain size, or if two of the following are exceeded: €4 million assets, €8 million net sales, or 50 employees (thresholds approximate). Audited financials must be filed with the Commercial Register as well.
•	Tax Compliance: Bulgaria operates on a self-assessment tax system. Companies make advance tax payments (quarterly for larger firms, annually for small) and reconcile in the annual return. Payroll taxes (withholding and social contributions) are remitted monthly. Non-compliance with tax filing or payment can lead to penalties and interest. Notably, Bulgaria has implemented EU anti-avoidance rules (like controlled foreign company rules, interest deduction limits, etc.) to prevent profit shifting (Doing business in Bulgaria ) (Doing business in Bulgaria ), so companies must ensure transfer pricing on related-party deals is arm’s length and properly documented.
In summary, Bulgarian businesses benefit from low flat tax rates and a relatively simple tax code. However, they must diligently maintain bookkeeping and file required returns (tax, VAT, social security, and annual reports) on time. Many businesses engage local accountants or accounting firms to manage these obligations. The National Revenue Agency (NRA) is the main authority for taxes and can perform audits or inspections to enforce compliance.
Funding Sources for Businesses
Access to finance is crucial for businesses. In Bulgaria, companies can tap into various funding sources, including private investment and public support:
•	Personal Investment and Bank Loans: Many founders start with personal or family funds. Bulgaria’s banking sector provides loans to businesses at competitive interest rates (as of 2025, typical SME loans have moderate interest given EU market conditions). Banks usually require collateral or guarantees for new businesses. The Bulgarian Development Bank (BDB) is a state-owned bank that offers targeted SME loans and guarantee schemes to encourage commercial banks to lend to startups and small businesses.
•	Business Angels: These are individual investors who provide capital in exchange for equity (or convertible debt) at an early stage. Bulgaria has an active but relatively small angel investor community. There are organizations and networks like Bulgarian Business Angels Association and regular events where startups pitch to angel investors. Angel investments not only bring money but also mentorship. The government has recognized the role of angels; in fact, under certain programs, tax incentives for angel investors have been discussed (Aid for SME’s access to financing ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (Aid for SME’s access to financing ● Ministry of Economy and Industry) (e.g. allowing tax relief for individuals who invest in startups, to stimulate risk financing). While these incentives are evolving, the presence of angels is a growing part of the ecosystem.
•	Venture Capital (VC) Funds: Over the last decade, Bulgaria’s startup scene has been bolstered by venture capital funds, some created with EU support. There are several VC funds based in Sofia that invest in high-growth potential companies – for example, LAUNCHub Ventures, Eleven Ventures, Innovation Capital, Vitosha Venture Partners, and others. Notably, Bulgaria leveraged EU structural funds to create a Fund of Funds which allocates public money to VC funds and accelerators, increasing available capital (Bulgaria Startup Ecosystem Country Guide) (Top 14 VC Funds and Angel Investors in Bulgaria - XYZ Lab). As a result, seed and Series A funding for Bulgarian startups has become more accessible, with typical ticket sizes ranging from €50k pre-seed to a few million euros in Series A. VC funding usually requires the company to be an LLC or JSC so that equity shares can be issued. These funds often co-invest with foreign venture funds for larger rounds.
•	Government Grants and EU Programs: Bulgarian companies (especially SMEs) can apply for various grant programs. Many are funded by the European Union through operational programs. For instance, under the EU’s structural funds (Operational Program "Innovation and Competitiveness" in the 2014-2020 period, now succeeded by new programs in 2021-2027), there have been grant schemes for technology upgrades, R&D, energy efficiency, and export promotion. These grants typically cover a percentage of project costs (e.g. 50% grant, 50% self-funded). Additionally, there are startup grant competitions at national and EU level (such as the EU Horizon Europe programs or EIT programs) that Bulgarian startups can access. The Bulgarian Small and Medium Enterprises Promotion Agency (BSMEPA) also runs programs – for example, voucher schemes for businesses to get consulting, or co-funding SMEs to attend international trade fairs. Moreover, innovation grants through the National Innovation Fund provide financing for R&D projects in companies. Recently, as part of recovery plans, there have been small business grant initiatives (for digitalization, green technology, etc.) (Innovation Ministry Promotes Small Business Grants in Key ... - BTA).
•	“Fund of Funds” Instruments: Bulgaria’s government, via the Fund of Funds (FoF), has launched financial instruments such as microfinance, seed funds, and acceleration programs using EU money. For example, a new €100M public-private fund was unveiled to boost startups and SMEs (New EU-backed €100M Financial Instrument for Bulgarian SMEs). These often work by the FoF investing in or guaranteeing private funds that then invest/loan to companies. Companies should watch calls from FoF or the Ministry of Innovation for equity instruments, loans with preferential terms, or guarantee schemes for easier credit.
•	Business Incubators and Accelerators: Alongside funding, incubators/accelerators provide small pre-seed capital plus mentorship in exchange for equity. Examples include Eleven, Founders Institute Sofia, and vertical-specific accelerators (in fintech, AI, etc.). They often grant €25k–€50k and a program of support.
•	Crowdfunding: While not yet widespread in Bulgaria, some startups have turned to crowdfunding platforms (like Kickstarter or local platforms) for product launch funding. Equity crowdfunding within Bulgaria is not fully developed, partly due to regulatory uncertainty (however EU-wide crowdfunding regulations now allow licensed platforms to operate).
•	Foreign Investment and Private Equity: Larger or growth-stage Bulgarian companies might attract foreign private equity or strategic investors. Bulgaria’s EU membership and stable currency (BGN is pegged to the Euro) makes it reasonably attractive. There are success stories of Bulgarian companies getting investment from big international funds or being acquired by global firms.
Important legal note: When raising funds, companies must comply with company law formalities. For example, issuing new shares in an LLC requires an increase of capital registered in the Commercial Register and possibly notary-certified resolutions if new owners join. In a JSC, issuing new shares or transferring shares must follow the Public Offering of Securities Act if it’s publicly listed. However, most private JSCs can issue shares to specific investors without a public prospectus (as long as it’s a private placement). Also, any shareholder agreements or investment agreements should be carefully drafted to protect the company and investors rights. Venture investments usually involve complex terms (board seats, veto rights, liquidation preferences) but those are by contract – Bulgarian law allows a lot of flexibility for internal arrangements, especially in JSCs via bylaw provisions or in LLCs via the Articles.
Additionally, to support financing:
•	Bulgaria provides export credit insurance (through BAEZ – Bulgarian Export Insurance Agency) to help companies export safely.
•	There are tax incentives for reinvestment (e.g. manufacturing companies can sometimes get 0% CIT if profits are invested in certain regions or activities, under specific conditions in the CIT Act).
•	EU “Next Generation” funds and Recovery and Resilience Plan – post-Covid, Bulgaria has RRF funds allocated to digital and green transition projects, some of which are channeled as grants or financial instruments for businesses (e.g. grants for solar installations on company buildings, etc.).
In summary, Bulgarian businesses have access to a mix of private capital (angels, VCs, banks) and public support (grants, subsidized instruments). Entrepreneurs should consider combining these – for instance, using a grant to develop a prototype and then raising VC to scale it. It’s advisable to consult the Ministry of Innovation and Growth, the InvestBulgaria Agency, or SME Promotion Agency for current programs, and to engage with the startup community to find investors.
Licensing and Permits by Industry
Starting the business is one step – operating it might require special licenses or permits, depending on the industry. Bulgaria regulates certain activities to protect public interest (health, safety, financial stability). The main law outlining licensing principles is the Law on Limiting Administrative Regulation and Administrative Control on Economic Activity, and various sector-specific laws list which businesses need a license, permit, or registration (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?) (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Below are some industries that require a license or permit to operate in Bulgaria (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?) (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?):
•	Finance and Insurance: Banking and insurance are heavily regulated. Banks must be licensed by the Bulgarian National Bank (meeting capital and fit-and-proper requirements) (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Insurance companies and pension funds need licensing by the Financial Supervision Commission (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Similarly, investment intermediaries (stock brokers), fund managers, payment institutions, and other financial services require licenses.
•	Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals: Medical services (hospitals, clinics, labs) need accreditation and authorization from the Ministry of Health (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Pharmacies require a permit and must be owned by a licensed master pharmacist. Manufacturing or distributing medicines requires a license from the Bulgarian Drug Agency. These ensure adherence to medical standards.
•	Food and Beverage: To operate a food production or processing facility, one must register with the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA) and meet sanitary standards (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Restaurants, cafes, and catering establishments require registration with BFSA as well (hygiene permits) and often need to be categorized by the municipality (especially if in tourism). Alcohol production or trade needs a license – e.g. distilleries are licensed, and selling alcohol in retail requires a permit (and registration under the Excise Duties Act) (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Tobacco products trade/manufacture also requires licensing due to health regulations (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry).
•	Transportation: Transport companies must get licensed for certain services. For example, a company offering freight transport or passenger transport (buses, taxis) needs a transport license from the Ministry of Transport (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Taxi drivers need municipal permits. International road haulage has an EU license regime. Also, civil aviation and shipping companies are licensed separately.
•	Education: Private schools, colleges, or training centers need authorization from the Ministry of Education (or relevant agency) to ensure they meet educational standards (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?) (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Even language centers often must register under the Education Act rules.
•	Construction and Real Estate: Construction companies must register in the Central Professional Register of Builders for certain categories of construction works (especially large projects) – this isn’t exactly a “license” but a qualification registration required by the Chamber of Builders (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Additionally, each construction project needs a construction permit from the local municipality’s building authority. Real estate agents don’t need a license, but starting 2024, those providing real estate intermediary services have to register due to AML laws (to ensure compliance) (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria) (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria).
•	Energy and Utilities: Activities in the energy sector (electricity generation, gas supply, oil refining) require licensing by the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). For example, operating a power plant or trading electricity needs a license. Similarly, fuel trading (petrol stations) requires registration under the Fuel Act.
•	Gambling: Casinos, lotteries, sports betting and any gambling activities are strictly licensed by the State Commission on Gambling. The license process is rigorous to prevent money laundering and protect consumers (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?).
•	Security Services: Private security companies (guard services, security system monitoring) need a license from the National Police per the Private Security Services Act (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). They must meet criteria for personnel training and equipment (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?).
•	Arms and Defense: Trading in weapons, ammunition, or explosives requires a special license from the Ministry of Economy/Interministerial Commission, as well as compliance with international arms trade controls (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?).
•	Tourism: Tour operators and travel agencies must be registered and licensed by the Ministry of Tourism. They need to meet insurance requirements and professional qualification criteria (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?) (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). Hotels and guest houses are categorized (1-star, 2-star, etc.) and must be registered with the municipality and Ministry of Tourism.
•	Manufacturing & Others: Various manufacturing sectors might require permits: e.g. waste management or recycling companies need permits from the Ministry of Environment, chemicals manufacturing might require environmental permits, mining requires a concession from the government, etc. Pawnshops have a registration regime and need a license for trading precious metals if they deal in such (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?).
Additionally, many professions and services operate under a registration regime (simpler than a license). For instance, starting a hair salon, car repair shop, or small retail store often just requires notifying the municipality or regional authority of commencement of activity (and meeting basic sanitary/fire safety rules) (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?) (What types of business activities need a license or permit in Bulgaria?). After notification, inspections may be conducted to verify compliance. Some of those may require a permit if they involve hazardous activities.
It’s critical to identify which laws regulate your specific industry. Operating without a required license can lead to heavy fines or closure orders. Entrepreneurs should check with the relevant ministry or regulator. The Ministry of Economy’s Point of Single Contact website (for service providers) can be helpful, as well as consulting legal advisors. Typically, the process for obtaining a license involves: proving the company meets certain criteria (capital, qualifications, facilities), submitting an application to the regulator, and waiting for approval. Licenses may have ongoing compliance requirements (e.g. periodic reporting, renewal fees).
Local permits: Aside from national licenses, businesses may need local permits. For example, a storefront might need a permit for signage from the city, and an establishment with extended working hours (like a bar) might need permission for late-night operation from the municipality. If you renovate a commercial space, you need a building permit from local authorities. Always check municipal ordinances for any local requirements on your business (cities often regulate noise, working times for commercial activities, outdoor advertising, etc.).
In summary, ensure you have all necessary licenses or registrations before starting operations. If you plan a business in a highly regulated field (finance, pharma, etc.), include the licensing timeline in your launch plan, as it can take a few months. Many licensing processes in Bulgaria have fees and require Bulgarian-language paperwork – engage local experts as needed.
Local and Location-Based Regulations
Where your business operates in Bulgaria can introduce additional legal considerations. Regulations can vary by municipality or region, and there are special zones with unique rules:
•	Municipal Regulations: Each municipality can impose certain rules through local ordinances. For instance, businesses must pay local taxes and fees in the municipality where they own property or generate waste. When you register your company, you declare a registered address – typically, local tax authorities will expect you to file declarations for any owned real estate at that address for property tax purposes. If you open a shop or restaurant, you might need to register it with the municipality’s trade register and comply with city-specific requirements (like obtaining a permit for retail activity and adhering to approved working hours). Many municipalities require businesses (especially in retail/food) to display their working hours and register them with the local government. For example, a shop in Sofia must notify the municipality of its opening and closing hours and any change thereto, to ensure compliance with noise and public order regulations.
•	Zoning and Urban Planning: If you operate from a commercial premise, ensure it’s zoned for that purpose. Using a residential property as an office or shop may require a change-of-use permit from the local architecture department. Bulgarian law distinguishes residential vs. commercial usage, and local authorities enforce zoning regulations. So, location matters – an industrial activity must be in an area zoned for industry. Also, if you plan to put up signage or outdoor advertising at your location, most cities require a permit and charge a fee.
•	Free Zones and Industrial Parks: Bulgaria has several free trade zones (e.g. near Burgas, Ruse, Svilengrad) and industrial parks that provide incentives. Companies operating in a designated free zone can benefit from customs and VAT advantages – goods can be imported, processed, and re-exported without formal customs clearance or VAT, unless they enter the domestic market. There aren’t additional legal exemptions on profits, but the logistic and tax deferral benefits are significant for trading companies. Industrial zones often offer ready infrastructure and sometimes tax incentives (for example, a municipality might waive local taxes for a few years for businesses in a certain industrial park to attract investment). If your business is export-oriented or manufacturing, exploring these zones could be beneficial.
•	Regional Development Incentives: The government provides extra incentives for investments in certain less-developed regions. Under the Investment Promotion Act, a project above certain thresholds can get Class A or Class B investor certificate, which might grant faster administrative services, infrastructure subsidies, or even partial tax breaks if in a high-unemployment region. These aren’t exactly location “regulations” but rather benefits tied to the location of an investment. For instance, setting up a factory in northwest Bulgaria (the least developed area) might qualify for government support.
•	Environmental and Local Impact: Depending on location, you might need environmental permits. If your business could impact the environment (e.g. manufacturing plant, waste generation, emissions), Bulgarian law (Environment Protection Act) may require you to undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) before setting up, especially if near protected areas. Also, water use permits are needed if you draw water or discharge wastewater, often handled by the Basin Directorate regionally. Local communities can influence or object to certain projects (public consultations happen during EIA).
•	Tourist Areas: If your business is in a designated resort or tourist area (e.g. along the Black Sea coast or in ski resorts like Bansko), there may be additional local rules. For instance, some resort towns have tourist taxes (a small fee per overnight stay that hotels collect from tourists and pay to the municipality). Also, in these zones, working hours for establishments can be extended in tourist season by local order, or noise control might be stricter after certain hours to preserve resort image.
•	Zonal Differentiation in Taxes: The patent tax (for small sole proprietor activities) that we mentioned is actually determined by municipalities and can vary by location and size of town. For example, the patent tax for a barber shop in Sofia might be higher than in a small town. So, the cost of that simplified tax depends on local council decisions (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). Additionally, garbage collection fees differ by municipality and sometimes by zone within a city (commercial areas might have higher rates).
•	Local Business Chambers: Some localities have business chambers or clusters that liaise with authorities. Joining such can help ensure you’re updated on local regulatory changes or initiatives (though not a legal requirement).
•	Workforce considerations: While labor law is national, if your business is in a municipality with high unemployment, there may be local labor office programs to subsidize hiring or training. Conversely, in big cities like Sofia, competition for skilled workers is stiff and local living costs (salaries, office rent) are higher – not a regulation, but a practical location-based factor.
In short, after handling national requirements, be sure to check at the local level where your business is established. Register with the municipality if required, pay attention to local taxes, and secure any city-level permits (for building use, signage, etc.). Always comply with local noise, waste, and safety ordinances – for example, a factory must not exceed local noise limits in residential areas, a restaurant must dispose of waste through the city system or licensed companies, etc. Keeping good relations with local authorities can make operations smoother; many cities have an economic development unit that helps investors navigate local rules.
Employment and Labor Laws in Bulgaria
When running a business with employees in Bulgaria, you must adhere to the Labour Code and related legislation, which protect employee rights and govern employer obligations. Bulgarian labor law is relatively worker-friendly and in line with EU standards on working conditions, non-discrimination, and health and safety. Below are the key aspects:
Employment Contracts: Employment must be based on a written contract between employer and employee, signed before the employee starts work. The contract should specify the job title, workplace, start date, duration (if fixed-term or indefinite), working hours, salary, and any probation period. A probation period of up to 6 months is allowed to test the employee’s performance. Once signed, the employer must register the contract with the National Revenue Agency (NRA) within 3 days (How To Register A Company In Bulgaria In 5 Easy Steps!) (this registration is done online and is crucial for the employee to be recognized for social security). Employers should also develop internal work rules and job descriptions.
Working Hours: The standard work schedule is 8 hours per day, 5 days a week (40 hours weekly) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). The Labor Code permits some flexibility – for instance, flexitime or summation of working time (calculating hours over a longer reference period) can be used with certain conditions (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). Overtime work is generally not allowed without limits – by law, overtime should be an exception and is capped at 150 hours per year for each employee (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). In certain sectors or with collective bargaining, this can extend to 300 hours/year max (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). Overtime must be paid at premium rates: 50% extra on workdays, 75% on weekends, and 100% on public holidays (or compensatory time off if agreed). The work day can be extended to 10 hours only in specific cases (e.g. summarized calculation) but weekly must not exceed 48 hours on average (as per EU Working Time Directive) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). Breaks: employees are entitled to a lunch break (not counted in working time, usually at least 30 min) and a daily rest of at least 12 hours between workdays. Weekly, they must have at least 2 consecutive rest days (normally Saturday and Sunday).
Minimum Wage: Bulgaria sets a national minimum wage, which is usually adjusted annually. As of 2023, the minimum monthly gross wage is BGN 780 (approximately €400) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). Employers cannot pay less than this for a full-time position. Salaries are typically paid monthly. All wages must be paid in Bulgarian leva (BGN) and documented with a payslip including tax and social security deductions.
Leave Entitlements:
•	Annual Paid Leave: Employees are entitled to at least 20 working days of paid vacation per year (which is 4 weeks) (Employee Leave Rights Under Bulgarian Labour Law (Guide 2025)) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). Public holidays (around 12-15 days a year) are separate and not counted against annual leave. New employees generally earn leave entitlement after 8 months of work (but many employers allow some leave earlier as a benefit). Unused leave can be carried over for up to the next year (with a 2-year limit) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). Employers must ensure employees take at least half their annual leave in the year due, if possible, as “pile-up” of leave is discouraged.
•	Sick Leave: Employees can take sick leave if ill, with a medical certificate. The first 3 days of each sick leave spell are paid by the employer at 70% of the normal wage (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). From the 4th day onward, the National Social Security Institute (NSSI) pays a sickness benefit (about 80% of wage for general illness, 90% for work injury). The total continuous sick leave can extend quite long if medically justified (up to 180 days in a year, extendable to 360 days with approval) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier).
•	Maternity and Parental Leave: Bulgaria provides very generous maternity leave. Mothers are entitled to 410 days (58.6 weeks) of maternity leave for each child, paid by social security at 90% of the mother’s gross salary (assuming at least 12 months of insurance) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). This includes 45 days before birth and the remainder after. The first 135 days are maternity and the rest is referred to as “looking after infant” leave which can be taken by the mother or transferred to the father after the baby turns 6 months. Fathers have the right to 15 days of paternity leave at the birth (paid 90%) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier), and additionally, after the baby is 6 months old, fathers can use “leave for raising a child up to 8 years” – effectively 2 months paid leave that the father can take (introduced as a newer benefit to encourage father involvement) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). After the maternity leave, either parent (or even a grandparent if they are employed) can take parental leave until the child is 2 years old, paid at a flat minimum wage rate. In practice, many mothers stay home for 1 or 2 years with their baby due to these provisions.
•	Other Leave: Employees can take paid leave for important personal or family events: e.g. marriage (2 days), death of a family member (2 days), blood donation (2 days), moving house (1 day), etc. There is also unpaid leave entitlement – an employee can request up to 30 days unpaid leave per year and the employer generally should grant it (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) (beyond 30 is mutual agreement). Education leave is available if an employee is studying while working – they may get some paid days off for exams or dissertation prep, especially if agreed or if the education is job-related (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier).
Employee Rights and Protections:
•	Non-Discrimination: Employers cannot discriminate based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation, disability, or political affiliation. Equal pay for equal work is mandated. There are laws protecting against harassment and requiring reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities.
•	Health and Safety: The employer must provide a safe and healthy working environment per the Health and Safety at Work Act. This includes training employees on safety, providing protective equipment, ensuring ergonomics, and conducting risk assessments. Companies above certain size must have a health and safety officer or appoint an external service. Medical check-ups for staff in specific jobs are required annually. Fire safety rules must be followed in workplaces.
•	Trade Unions and Collective Bargaining: Employees have the right to form or join trade unions. If a union is present, they may engage in collective bargaining for better terms than the legal minimum. Collective labor agreements can cover entire sectors (via branch unions and employer associations) or just one company. Employers must also allow employee representatives for information and consultation in companies with 50+ staff (EU Information and Consultation Directive).
•	Working Time Records: Employers must keep records of hours worked, overtime, and leave. There’s a requirement to report working hours for certain categories (especially if overtime is done).
•	Youth and Child Labor: Hiring minors under 18 requires permission from the Labor Inspectorate and there are strict limits on their working hours (e.g. no overtime, and maximum 7 hours/day for 16-18 year-olds, 4 hours for 14-15 in allowed light work) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier). Under 14 cannot be employed except in some cultural/advertising activities with special permission.
•	Termination of Employment: Firing employees in Bulgaria has to follow the Labor Code. There are specific lawful grounds for dismissal (e.g. redundancy, lack of qualities, disciplinary misconduct, long-term illness absence, etc.). “Termination by mutual agreement” is common (both sides agree in writing). If an employer initiates dismissal, they often must give a notice period of 30 days (for indefinite contracts) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier), unless a longer notice is agreed (but max 3 months). For fixed-term contracts, early termination is limited to certain cases. Some grounds require no notice (dismissal for serious misconduct). Severance pay: if an employee is laid off due to reduction in force or closure of activity, they get at least one month’s salary as severance. Long tenure employees may get more (e.g. one month for each year beyond 10 years, capped at certain months). Unlawful termination can be contested in court, and if found illegal, the employee can be reinstated and owed back pay.
•	Protective Provisions: Some categories have extra protection – e.g. you generally cannot dismiss a pregnant woman, a woman on maternity leave, or a parent of a small child without prior Labor Inspectorate consent. Employees on sick leave or vacation also cannot be terminated (until they return).
•	Labor Inspection: The General Labor Inspectorate Agency oversees compliance. They can conduct checks and impose fines for violations of labor laws (for example, undeclared “off the books” employment, not paying overtime, poor safety conditions, etc.). Employers must also have workplace posters or info on health & safety, working hours, etc., as required.
Social Insurance and Benefits: Employers must enroll employees in the state social security system. Contributions cover:
•	Pension fund (for retirement).
•	Health Insurance (for medical coverage under the National Health Insurance Fund).
•	Unemployment fund (enabling laid-off employees to get unemployment benefits if eligible).
•	General sickness and maternity fund (to pay those sick leave and maternity benefits).
•	Occupational injury and disease (the rate depends on company’s risk category).
The employer withholds the employee’s share from salary and adds the employer share, sending the total to the NSSI/NRA monthly. Additionally, employers with 50+ employees must hire a certain quota of people with disabilities or if they don’t, contribute to a fund for employment of disabled persons (recent legislation on this quota). All employers must ensure accessibility if they have disabled employees.
Payroll: By law, wages must be paid at least monthly. Employers also withhold the 10% income tax on salaries (PAYE) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) (Bulgaria Employment Laws: Complete Guide for Employers - Multiplier) and pay it to the tax authority along with social contributions each month.
Other Obligations:
•	Employers should maintain a labor book (record) for each employee – an official booklet noting the employment periods, used for pension calculations.
•	When hiring, foreigners must have work permits or be EU citizens (EU citizens can work freely; non-EU require work authorization unless they have permanent residence or other exemptions).
•	If the business transfers (sale of company or merger), employees are protected by the EU Transfer of Undertakings (TUPE) rules – their contracts carry over to the new owner with same terms.
In summary, treat employees fairly and follow procedures. It’s wise to have an HR specialist or legal counsel prepare standard employment contracts and advise on terminations to avoid legal pitfalls. Observing labor laws not only avoids sanctions but also contributes to a stable and motivated workforce.
Intellectual Property Protection and Trademarks
Protecting your business’s intellectual property (IP) is crucial, and Bulgarian law provides multiple avenues, harmonized with EU law:
•	Trademarks: If you have a brand name, logo, or slogan, consider registering it as a trademark. In Bulgaria, trademarks are registered through the Bulgarian Patent Office (BPO). Any individual or company (Bulgarian or foreign) can apply for a national trademark (National trademark). The process is as follows: an application is filed (in Bulgarian) with details of the mark and the specific classes of goods/services it will cover (according to the Nice Classification) (National trademark). The application can be filed on paper, online via the BPO e-portal, or even by fax (with originals mailed within a month) (National trademark). There are fees based on the number of classes – e.g. BGN 520 for up to 3 classes, plus BGN 30 for each additional class (National trademark). The Patent Office examines the application for formalities and absolute grounds (distinctiveness, not descriptive, etc.) (National trademark). If all is fine, the mark is published in the Official Bulletin for opposition. There is a 3-month opposition period during which others can oppose if they have earlier rights. If no opposition (or if opposition is rejected), the Patent Office will register the trademark and issue a certificate. A Bulgarian trademark registration is valid for 10 years from the filing date, and can be renewed indefinitely every 10 years with payment of renewal fees (Bulgarian Trademark Registration - costs and requirements - KTpatent). Owning a trademark gives you the exclusive right to use that mark for the protected goods/services in Bulgaria and to prevent others from using confusingly similar marks. Note, Bulgaria is also party to the Madrid System for international trademark registration – you can seek protection in multiple countries via one application. Additionally, one can opt for an EU Trade Mark (EUTM) via the EUIPO, which covers all EU member states (including Bulgaria) in one go. An EUTM might be cost-effective if you plan to operate across Europe.
•	Patents: If your business involves inventions or new technical solutions, you may seek patent protection. A Bulgarian patent is obtained by filing an application with the Patent Office and undergoing examination. Patents are granted for inventions that are new, involve an inventive step, and are industrially applicable. The term of a patent is 20 years from filing, subject to annual maintenance fees. Bulgaria is part of the European Patent Convention – you can file a European Patent application via the EPO and designate Bulgaria, in which case after grant, the patent needs validation in Bulgaria (including a translation of claims to Bulgarian) (National trademark). Also, simpler inventions can be protected as utility models (“small patents”) in Bulgaria, which are registered faster (no substantive examination) and last up to 10 years. Patents give the owner exclusive rights to the invention – meaning you can stop others from making or using the patented product or process. It’s important to file before any public disclosure of your invention (novelty is key).
•	Copyright: Copyright protects original works of authorship – literature, software code, art, music, etc. In Bulgaria (as in most countries), copyright arises automatically upon creation of the work – there is no need (and indeed no formal system) to register copyrights for them to be valid. The author (or the employer, if it’s a work made for hire such as software by an employee) has exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, perform, etc. The duration of copyright is the life of the author plus 70 years (for software and some other works it’s 70 years from publication if corporate author). There is a voluntary copyright register maintained by the culture ministry for some works (mainly to deposit a copy for evidence), but registration is not required for protection. Software is protected as literary work. Businesses should ensure they have clear agreements assigning IP from employees or contractors to the company (Bulgarian law says software created by an employee is automatically the employer’s copyright, but it’s wise to have explicit clauses). If you produce content, consider marking it with © and your name/year to signal your claim.
•	Designs: Industrial designs (the aesthetic appearance of products) can be registered in Bulgaria via the Patent Office. A registered design (valid 10 years, renewable up to 25) gives you rights over the visual design of an item (e.g. fashion designs, furniture, packaging). Bulgaria also participates in the EU Community Design system, where a single registration covers all EU countries.
•	Trade Secrets: Bulgaria has a Protection of Trade Secrets Act (aligned with the EU Trade Secrets Directive). If your business information (client lists, formulas, etc.) has commercial value from being secret and you take reasonable steps to keep it secret, the law can protect against its unlawful acquisition or disclosure by others. Ensure you use NDAs and internal confidentiality policies to safeguard trade secrets – these legal measures help demonstrate the “reasonable steps” taken to protect secrecy.
•	Domains: If you want a website with .bg domain, note that registering a .bg domain has some rules. Generally, you need to have a local presence or a trademark. The .bg registry often requires either a Bulgarian company/person or a trademark that matches the name. Ensure you secure relevant domain names early to avoid cybersquatting issues.
•	Enforcement: If someone violates your IP rights, Bulgarian law provides remedies. For trademark or patent infringement, you can file a civil lawsuit seeking an injunction to stop use and damages for losses. In urgent cases, preliminary injunctions can be obtained fairly quickly to cease infringement. The Customs can assist via border measures – you can register your trademark or other IP with Customs, and they will seize counterfeit goods at the border. Bulgaria’s Commission for Protection of Competition also sanctions certain IP violations like copying product look (unfair competition). Piracy (e.g. software piracy, counterfeit goods) can even lead to criminal penalties under the Penal Code, enforced by the police.
•	IP Agreements: If you develop IP in collaboration or hire third parties, make sure contracts clarify who owns the resulting IP. Bulgarian companies often ensure employees sign invention assignment agreements (though by law, employee inventions may belong to the employer if made in the course of duty, but formal assignment is cleaner for patents). If using open-source software or third-party content, comply with licenses to avoid infringement claims.
Overall, register what is registerable (trademarks, patents, designs) to strengthen your protection, and use contracts to clarify IP ownership. The Bulgarian Patent Office’s website provides guidelines and forms (National trademark) (National trademark), and they have an English interface as well. For international markets, leverage EU-wide IP protections. By securing your IP, you add value to your business and prevent others from freeloading on your brand or innovations.
Compliance, Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Data Protection
Operating a business also involves complying with cross-cutting regulations such as anti-money laundering rules, personal data protection (GDPR), and other corporate compliance requirements.
Anti-Money Laundering (AML): Bulgaria has implemented EU AML Directives through the Measures Against Money Laundering Act (MAMLA) and the Measures Against Terrorist Financing Act. These laws impose obligations on certain businesses (called “obliged entities”) to prevent money laundering:
•	Who must comply? Banks, financial institutions, currency exchange offices, casinos, real estate brokers, dealers in high-value goods (cars, art, jewelry), accountants, auditors, tax consultants, notaries (when handling property transactions), lawyers (for certain client transactions), and even services like company formation agents, among others, are obliged entities under the AML law (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria) (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria). Recent amendments in 2023 expanded coverage – notably consultants providing company registration or real estate deal assistance must register and comply with AML (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria) (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria). If your business falls into these categories, you must implement AML measures.
•	Customer Due Diligence: Obliged companies must perform due diligence on their customers – verifying identity (ID cards, company registry documents), determining the ultimate beneficial owner (UBO) of corporate clients, and assessing the risk of money laundering. For higher-risk situations (large transactions, non-face-to-face clients, PEPs (politically exposed persons)), enhanced checks are needed.
•	UBO Register: All companies in Bulgaria (except public-listed ones) are required to declare their Ultimate Beneficial Owners to the Commercial Register (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria) (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria). This stems from EU AML Directive 4. Companies had to file a declaration identifying the individuals who ultimately control or own them (usually those with over 25% ownership, directly or indirectly). The UBO information is recorded and (partially) publicly accessible. As of 2023, new rules require providing not just names but also details on the size/nature of the ownership and supporting documents proving the ownership chain (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria) (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria). Ensure when you register your company, you submit the UBO declaration (if you have a simple ownership structure, e.g. one individual owner, it’s straightforward; if a chain of entities, you must trace to the final individuals). Keeping this info updated is also required (any change in UBO must be declared within 7 days of knowledge).
•	Internal Controls: Companies under AML obligations must have internal policies, appoint an AML compliance officer, and train their staff to recognize and report suspicious activity. Transactions above certain thresholds (e.g. large cash transactions over €10,000) are subject to scrutiny. Actually, note that Bulgaria also has a Cash Payments Limitation Act that prohibits cash payments above BGN 10,000 (approx €5,100) – any amount above must be paid via bank. This is to curb money laundering and tax evasion. So businesses must make large payments by bank transfer.
•	Reporting: If an obliged company suspects a transaction or client is linked to money laundering or terrorism, it must file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with the Financial Intelligence Directorate (FID) of SANS (State Agency for National Security) (Doing business in Bulgaria ) (Doing business in Bulgaria ). The FID is Bulgaria’s FIU (financial intelligence unit) that collects and analyzes these reports. There are also requirements to report cash transactions above certain amounts and to refrain from tipping off the client.
•	Penalties: Non-compliance with AML requirements can lead to significant fines (which have increased with EU directives – in serious cases up to millions of BGN or a percentage of turnover) and other sanctions, even revocation of licenses for banks or financial firms.
Even if your business is not directly an “obliged entity”, having basic AML awareness is good practice, especially if you deal with large cash or high-risk customers. For instance, many businesses avoid accepting large cash payments altogether to stay safe. Also, know your partners – when engaging B2B, ensure the other company is not sanctioned or blacklisted. Bulgaria follows UN and EU sanctions lists; dealing with sanctioned entities/persons (e.g. under EU sanctions on certain countries) is prohibited.
Data Protection (GDPR): Since May 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies in Bulgaria. Additionally, Bulgaria has a national Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) that aligns with GDPR and provides some local specifications (Data Protected Bulgaria | Insights | Linklaters). Key points for businesses:
•	Personal Data: If your business collects or processes personal data (which includes any information identifying individuals – customers, employees, etc.), you must comply with GDPR principles: lawfulness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity/confidentiality.
•	Legal Basis: You need a legal basis for processing personal data – commonly it’s consent (e.g. for marketing mailing lists), or contractual necessity (processing customer address to deliver goods), legal obligation (keeping employee records, issuing invoices), legitimate interest, etc. Sensitive personal data (health, racial origin, etc.) have stricter rules.
•	Data Subject Rights: Individuals have rights to access their data, correct it, delete it (“right to be forgotten”), and portability, among others. You must be prepared to respond to such requests within 1 month.
•	Privacy Notice: You need to provide a clear privacy notice to individuals when collecting their data, explaining what data you collect, for what purpose, how long you keep it, with whom you share it, and their rights.
•	Data Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect personal data from breach – both technical (encryption, firewalls) and organizational (access controls, training staff on confidentiality).
•	Data Protection Officer (DPO): If your core activities involve large-scale processing of sensitive data or systematic monitoring of individuals (or if you’re a public body), you may be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer (Data Protected Bulgaria | Insights - Linklaters) (Data Protected Bulgaria | Insights - Linklaters). Most ordinary SMEs won’t need a formal DPO, but they still must ensure compliance. Note, some Bulgarian companies voluntarily appoint a DPO to manage GDPR compliance even if not mandatory.
•	Cross-Border: If you transfer personal data outside the EU (e.g. using a US cloud provider), you must ensure the transfer is lawful under GDPR (using standard contractual clauses or other transfer mechanisms, given the strict rules post-Schrems II decision).
•	Bulgarian DPA: The supervising authority is the Commission for Personal Data Protection (CPDP) (Data Protected Bulgaria | Insights | Linklaters). Businesses may need to consult CPDP for certain things (like prior consultation if a DPIA – Data Protection Impact Assessment – shows high risk). The CPDP also handles complaints from individuals. The PDPA introduced some specifics, like rules about processing national ID numbers, video surveillance, and age of consent for children’s data (which is 14 in Bulgaria for information society services).
•	Enforcement: GDPR fines can be very high (up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover, whichever is higher). In Bulgaria, CPDP has issued fines (though most Bulgarian fines have been modest so far, larger companies have faced bigger penalties for serious breaches).
•	Practical steps: For a typical business, compliance means: having customers or website users consent for marketing emails; keeping customer data only as long as needed (e.g. if someone signs up on your site, don’t keep their data forever if not needed); securing any personal data you store (lock file cabinets, password protect files); and not using personal data for purposes the person didn’t agree to. Also, if your website uses cookies that track personal data, you need a cookie consent banner (per ePrivacy rules). If there’s a data breach (e.g. you discover your database was hacked), you must notify CPDP within 72 hours and possibly the affected individuals if it’s high risk.
Other Compliance Areas:
•	Consumer Protection: If your business deals with consumers (B2C), you must follow the Consumer Protection Act. This includes rules on fair advertising, contract terms, warranty periods (legal guarantee of 2 years for consumer goods), right of return for online sales (14-day no-questions return for online or off-premises sales), displaying prices with VAT, issuing receipts (fiscal receipt from a cash register for cash sales is mandatory). The Consumer Protection Commission oversees these. Unfair commercial practices (misleading or aggressive tactics) are prohibited.
•	Competition/Antitrust: The Law on Protection of Competition prohibits cartels, abuse of dominant position, and unfair competition. For most small businesses this isn’t a concern unless you become a market leader, but even at small scale, things like false claims about competitors or imitating a competitor’s product get-up could breach unfair competition provisions. If you plan agreements with suppliers or distributors, avoid exclusivity or pricing terms that could raise antitrust issues without legal review.
•	Environmental Compliance: Depending on your activities, you may need to comply with waste management rules (e.g. if you produce packaging, you must pay product tax or join a recycling organization; if you emit air pollutants, you need permits). Bulgaria has various environmental regulations (air, water, waste) aligned with EU directives. Manufacturing businesses should obtain all relevant environmental permits from the Regional Inspectorate of Environment.
•	GDPR for Employees: Remember GDPR also applies to employee data – keep HR data secure, only use for legitimate purposes (e.g. you can’t publish everyone’s salary unless needed for work reasons), and include a privacy notice for employees too.
•	Public Procurement: If you aim to bid for government contracts, you’ll need to comply with the Public Procurement Act. That involves procedures and criteria (like providing certificates of clean record, tax compliance, etc.). Also note, companies convicted of certain offenses or not in good standing can be barred from public tenders.
•	Anti-Corruption: Bulgaria criminalizes bribery of public officials. Companies should institute a zero-tolerance policy on bribery. If operating in sectors interacting with officials (construction permits, customs, etc.), ensure no facilitation payments are made. An anti-corruption compliance program, while not mandatory for private firms, is a good practice especially if dealing with public sector.
•	Occupational safety and health (OSH): As mentioned in labor, beyond treating employees well, specific compliance includes risk assessments and preventive measures for workplace safety. Failure in this area can lead not only to labor fines but liability if accidents occur.
•	Insurance: Some sectors or activities require compulsory insurance (e.g. tour operators must have liability insurance; construction companies need insurance for certain projects; vehicles must have motor third-party insurance). Also, while not mandatory by law, many businesses take out General Liability Insurance to cover any harm to third parties or Property Insurance for their premises/assets.
In essence, Bulgarian business regulation has many facets, but they mirror EU standards. A prudent approach is to conduct a compliance audit when starting and periodically after. This means checking: “Are we doing everything required in accounting? In tax? In HR? In data protection? In licenses?” Using professional services (lawyers, accountants, HSE consultants) can help navigate these requirements initially and avoid problems later. Non-compliance can result in fines, business suspension, or legal liability, so it pays to be proactive.
Changes in Business Structure and Dissolution
Over time, a business might need to change its legal form, merge with another, or cease operations. Bulgarian law provides procedures for these transformations and dissolutions, which companies must follow to stay compliant.
Changing Legal Form (Transformation): The Commerce Act allows a company to transform through merger, consolidation, division (split-up or spin-off), or conversion (change of form). For example, an OOD can transform into an AD, or two companies can merge into one. These processes typically involve:
•	Decision by Owners: A general meeting of shareholders/partners must approve the transformation plan (with a supermajority, often 2/3 or 3/4 of shares, depending on the form). In single-owner entities, the owner decides.
•	Drafting a Transformation Plan: This legal document outlines the terms (e.g. for a merger, which company absorbs which, exchange ratio of shares; for conversion, what changes in capital for new form). Often, an independent auditor’s report is required (especially for mergers/splits in JSCs) to protect shareholder and creditor interests.
•	Notifications: Creditors and minority shareholders have rights in transformations. Usually the company must announce the transformation in the Commercial Register and perhaps the State Gazette, giving creditors the opportunity to claim security or object within a certain time.
•	Registration of Change: The transformation is completed when it is entered in the Commercial Register. For instance, if an OOD converts to AD, the registry will reflect the new legal form and new constitutional documents (statutes) for the AD.
•	Effect: By law, in a merger or split, all assets, rights, and liabilities of the company are transferred to the successor (universal succession). This means contracts don’t need individual novation – they automatically continue with the new entity, and the old one, if disappearing, is struck off.
•	Simpler changes like changing the company name, registered address, business scope, or managers just require a shareholders’ resolution and registration of the amendment in the Commercial Register. Changing owners (selling company shares) also must be registered: for an OOD, share transfers must be notarized and then filed; for a JSC, share transfers are recorded in the shareholder book but not in the register except if it changes the directors or UBO info.
Dissolution and Liquidation: If owners decide to close the business voluntarily, or if certain conditions mandate it, the company must go through liquidation to officially terminate its existence:
•	Dissolution Triggers: A company may be dissolved by a resolution of the shareholders (voluntary dissolution), or automatically upon expiry of term (if it was set up for a limited duration), or by court order (e.g. if it’s declared bankrupt, or its registration is invalidated, or it violates law).
•	Appointing a Liquidator: In voluntary dissolution, the shareholders appoint a liquidator (often the manager or an accountant/lawyer) to wind up the company (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). If they don’t, the court can appoint one. The liquidator’s role is similar to a trustee: they represent the company during liquidation, settle debts, and distribute assets.
•	Notifications and Claims: The liquidator must publish an invitation to creditors in the Commercial Register, informing any unknown or non-current creditors that the company is liquidating and they should file claims within a specified period (at least 6 months) (Bulgaria: Anti-Money Laundering Updates - Baker Tilly Bulgaria) (Choice of legal form, registration documents and procedure ● Ministry of Economy and Industry). This notice is usually automatically visible once dissolution is registered. During this period, the liquidator assesses all claims, sells assets if needed to pay debts, and in general wraps up affairs.
•	Settling Obligations: The company must pay all its debts. If assets are insufficient, the liquidator might propose a distribution or, if truly insolvent, the process may convert to bankruptcy. Assuming assets cover debts, the liquidator pays creditors in priority order (secured creditors first, then others). Any remaining assets or cash are then distributed to the owners (shareholders) according to their share in the capital.
•	Final Steps: Once debts are settled and assets distributed, the liquidator prepares a liquidation balance sheet and report. They also ensure that all mandatory records (accounting documents, employment records) will be archived as required by law (accounting records must be kept 10 years, etc., even after liquidation – usually handed over to an archive or a responsible person). Finally, the liquidator requests the deletion of the company from the Commercial Register. After deletion, the company ceases to exist as a legal entity.
•	Timeframe: Voluntary liquidation in Bulgaria takes at minimum 6 months (because of the creditor notice period) but often around 8-12 months to complete formalities. It can be longer if asset sales or creditor negotiations take time.
•	Bankruptcy (Insolvency): If a company cannot pay its debts when due, it must file for insolvency in court (or creditors can petition). The court may declare the company bankrupt and initiate insolvency proceedings, appointing a syndic (insolvency trustee). In insolvency, the goal is either to rescue (via rehabilitation plan) or to sell off assets and pay creditors. At the end, the company is dissolved by the court. Company directors have a duty to file for bankruptcy within 30 days of becoming insolvent or over-indebted; failure to do so can incur liability.
•	Strike off for inactivity: The Commercial Register can strike off companies that are not active (e.g. failed to file reports for years) but this is a separate administrative procedure and still involves liquidation if assets exist. Recently, an easier “summary liquidation” was allowed for companies with no assets and no debts, making it quicker to close defunct firms.
•	Sole Trader Closure: A sole proprietor (ET) can cease business by an application to deregister from the register. The individual remains personally liable for any outstanding debts even after closure. There’s no formal liquidation because it’s not a separate entity – but practically, one should settle business obligations (close VAT number if registered, pay off creditors) before deregistration.
Changes in Ownership Structure: If your business brings in new partners or investors, you might be transferring shares or equity:
•	In an OOD, transfer of company shares between existing partners or to new ones requires a notarized transfer contract and a resolution of the general meeting approving the transfer. After that, the Commercial Register must be updated with the new ownership structure. If one person buys out all shares, the OOD can convert to a single-member EOOD (again by resolution and register update).
•	In an AD, shares (if issued as physical or electronic records) can be transferred by endorsement (for bearer shares) or by contract (for registered shares). AD share transfers are not recorded in the Commercial Register (only the company’s internal book changes), except if it triggers changes in the board or if a single shareholder holds 100% (then it becomes EAD, which might be noted).
•	Capital Increase/Decrease: Changing capital (issuing new shares, or reducing capital to cover losses or withdraw a shareholder) is another structural change. This requires a formal decision of shareholders and registry filing. For an LLC, increasing capital means existing or new partners contribute more and you file amended Articles. Decreasing capital to return funds or eliminate shares has to allow creditor objections (creditors get a chance to object or require security before a capital decrease is registered, similar to liquidation notice but shorter).
•	Company Splits or Mergers: In practice, small businesses rarely do these, but larger groups might merge subsidiaries. Mergers can be streamlined if between parent and 100% owned subsidiary (not requiring complex exchange ratios). All mergers or de-mergers get announced in the Commercial Register for transparency.
Selling the Business: Instead of closing, an owner might just sell the company as a going concern. If you sell shares, as noted, it’s a straightforward share transfer. Alternatively, a business could sell its assets or a distinct line of business – in that case, labor law has the concept of succession of employment if an enterprise or part of it is sold; employees transfer to the buyer with their contracts intact. Tax-wise, a sale of a whole enterprise might have specific treatments (like not charging VAT if it qualifies as a transfer of going concern under VAT law). Professional advice is recommended for structuring a sale.
After Dissolution: Once a company is liquidated and removed from the register, if some asset or liability is later discovered, the law provides that it can be dealt with (e.g. distribute discovered asset to ex-owners or have them pay a remaining debt up to what they received). But essentially, the entity is gone and cannot conduct new business.
Records Keeping: Upon dissolution, all company documents should be stored (often given to one of the former owners or liquidator to keep). The BULSTAT number of a struck-off company can eventually be reused by the Register for new entities after some years, so it’s important to keep the history documents.
In sum, business transformations and closures must be done through formal procedures – one cannot simply abandon a company without following legal steps, as the entity will continue to exist and accrue obligations (like annual filing duties) until properly dissolved. Ensure to plan the exit strategy: if you anticipate no longer needing the company, budget time and perhaps legal help for the liquidation. For structural changes like adding investors or merging, coordinate with lawyers and auditors to fulfill all requirements so that the changes are valid and enforceable.
Other Legal Requirements and Considerations
Beyond the major topics above, here are additional Bulgarian legal considerations that can affect businesses:
•	Consumer Rights and E-commerce: If you sell to consumers (B2C), be aware of strong consumer protection laws. For distance sales (online or phone sales), consumers have a 14-day right to withdraw (return) goods or cancel services without penalty, as per EU law. Your website must clearly display terms and conditions, including the trader’s identity, prices (with taxes/shipping), and the returns policy. Also, an EU Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) link should be provided on your site. Issuing proper receipts/invoices for sales is a must, and if selling online, compliance with GDPR in handling customer data is critical. Unfair contract terms (like clauses that heavily favor the seller, or waiving liability for defective products) are unenforceable. For physical sales, consumers have rights to legal warranty repairs or replacements for faulty goods up to 2 years. There is also a Commission for Consumer Protection that monitors and can fine traders for violations (such as misleading advertising or sales of dangerous products).
•	Product Regulations: If your business involves products (toys, electronics, food, cosmetics, machinery, etc.), ensure they meet EU standards (CE marking where required, safety standards, labeling in Bulgarian language for consumer products, etc.). Bulgaria, being an EU member, enforces EU regulations on product safety. For example, food products must have labels in Bulgarian with ingredients, shelf life, producer info; electrical goods need CE mark and user manual in Bulgarian; textiles need composition labels; etc.
•	Data Retention and Electronic Communications: If you are a telecom provider or offering public internet, there are data retention laws (for law enforcement purposes, retention of traffic data for 6 months). But this usually concerns telecom companies or ISPs, not typical businesses.
•	Advertising and Media: Advertising certain products (like tobacco, prescription drugs, gambling) is restricted or prohibited. If your business involves marketing, be mindful of these rules. All advertising must be truthful and not mislead consumers; comparative advertising is allowed only if it meets fairness criteria.
•	Language: Bulgarian is the official language, so official correspondence with authorities must be in Bulgarian. While you can draft contracts in English (and many foreign investor contracts are bilingual), note that if a dispute goes to a Bulgarian court, a Bulgarian translation will be needed. Labor contracts with employees should be in Bulgarian (can be bilingual but Bulgarian prevails). Product manuals for consumer goods must be in Bulgarian.
•	Litigation and Dispute Resolution: If your business faces a dispute, the court system is available, though it can be slow for complex cases. Many businesses include arbitration clauses in B2B contracts to resolve disputes via arbitration (for example, arbitration at the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce or ICC arbitration if international). Just note that consumer disputes cannot be forced into arbitration under unfair terms. For debt collection, there’s an order for payment procedure that is relatively quick to get a writ of execution if the debtor doesn’t contest.
•	Significant Shareholders (for JSCs): If you become a public company (listed on stock exchange), there are extra rules: any acquisition above certain percentages (like 5%, 10% etc.) must be disclosed, and a tender offer is required if someone exceeds 1/3 or 50% thresholds. But that’s for publicly listed companies – not common for new businesses.
•	Sectoral Compliance: Certain sectors have their own regulators and compliance regimes. For example, if you run a pharmacy, the Regional Health Inspectorate oversees you; if an agricultural business, there are veterinary or phyto-sanitary rules for farming; if an IT company providing digital services, note the new EU Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act if applicable (mostly for bigger online platforms).
•	Import/Export: For companies engaged in import/export, compliance with customs regulations is required. As an EU member, trading within the EU is free of customs duties but you must do Intrastat declarations if volumes exceed thresholds. For exports outside EU or imports, you’ll deal with customs – ensure correct tariff classification and that you have any import licenses (e.g. for pharmaceuticals or certain chemicals). Also, export control: if your products are dual-use (could have military applications), you may need an export license.
•	Intoxicating Substances: If you manufacture or trade in alcohol, you’re subject to excise duties and need registration with the Customs Agency (which administers excise). Similar for fuel or tobacco – excise goods. These come with additional reporting (monthly excise declarations) and sometimes needing a bank guarantee to cover potential excise.
•	Covid-19/Emergency rules: In recent times, Bulgaria (like others) had emergency legislation during the pandemic affecting business (rent deferrals, work-from-home regulations, etc.). While these were temporary, it highlights that in extraordinary situations, the government can impose special rules (under the Disaster Protection Act or emergency acts) that businesses must follow for public health or safety.
•	Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Not a legal requirement per se, but there are expectations and soft laws. Large companies must do non-financial reporting (EU directive on non-financial info) about environmental and social impact. Even if not required, adopting CSR practices can improve reputation.
•	Electronic Documents and Signatures: Bulgarian law recognizes electronic signatures. Businesses can use qualified e-signatures for documents and even to interact with government (e.g. submit tax returns, register companies, etc., as we saw). Keep in mind an electronic document is valid if properly signed with a qualified e-signature (deemed equivalent to handwritten). This helps move to paperless processes, but also ensure cybersecurity measures are in place – with the digitization of business (cloud services, online banking), be vigilant about data breaches, use proper cybersecurity tools, and maybe cyber insurance.
Finally, always stay informed about legal changes. Bulgaria, as part of the EU, frequently updates laws to transpose new EU directives or regulations. Engaging with a local chamber of commerce or having legal counsel on retainer can help keep your business compliant. By systematically addressing legal aspects – from establishment, through daily operations, to potential closure – you can operate confidently and focus on growth, knowing you are on firm legal ground.
